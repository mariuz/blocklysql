# BlocklySQL - a block-based editor for SQL
This is a block-based editor for SQL (on the basis of Google's blockly (https://github.com/google/blockly)). We build this editor for the use in Computer Science (CS) classrooms. 

![BlocklySQL example snippet](example.JPG)

This first example uses a weather database and returns the locations where more than five gale-force winds with the  have been recorded (and the corresponding number of gale-force winds). It is equivalent to the following SELECT-statement in SQL:

```
SELECT Wetterstation.Standort, Wettermessung.Max_Windgeschwindigkeit AS #OrkanbÃ¶en
FROM Wetterstation 
JOIN Wettermessung ON Wetterstation.S_ID = Wettermessung.Standort_ID
WHERE Wettermessung.Max_Windgeschwindigkeit > 32.7
GROUP BY Wetterstation.Standort 
HAVING COUNT Wettermessung.Max_Windgeschwindigkeit > 5
ORDER BY Wettermessung.Max_Windgeschwindigkeit DESC;
```

## Elements

We have created several blocks to build queries with our editor. So far the following blocks have been created:

| BlocklySQL | Explanation |
| :-: | :-: |
| ![Statements and clauses]() | `Statements and clauses` |
| ![Tables and attributes]() | `Tables and attributes` |
| ![(Logical) operators]() | `(Logical) operators` |
| ![(Mathematical) operators]() | `(Mathematical) operators` |
| ![Value inputs]() | `Value inputs` |
| ![Aggregate functions]() | `Aggregate functions` |

## Example projects

So far our editor has been included in the project "dbup2date" (https://dbup2date.uni-bayreuth.de/blocklysql/index.html) by the University of Bayreuth, Germany. This project provides daily updated databases (football, weather) to use in CS classrooms. Go and check it out!

## Installing

You are welcome to use our editor. You can either integrate it into your online project or use it and your local machine using the software suite XAMPP (https://www.apachefriends.org/de/index.html). 

## Contributing

In case you want to extend or adapt our editor go ahead and fork this repo. We are interested in your ideas so please let us know about your them and show us what you have done. 

### Adding new blocks

New blocks can be added by creating `new_block.js` in the folder `sql/js/sql_blocks`. Additionally, for the new block to appear in the toolbox you have to import the file (using `<script></script>`) and add it to the toolbox in `index.html`.

The code of a block for our editor looks similiar to the code of the `AND` block:

Block definition:

Block function:
